## 10. Alternative Manual ML Pipeline (2025)

In addition to the Azure AutoML-based solution, this repository now includes a fully custom **driver churn prediction pipeline** built entirely with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

This version showcases transparent, code-first modeling — enabling flexibility, explainability, and reproducibility — without reliance on AutoML platforms.

### 🔍 Highlights:
- Manual data cleaning, KNN imputation, and SMOTE-based class balancing
- Extensive feature engineering (`Income_per_Tenure`, `Tenure`, etc.)
- Five ensemble models: **RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost**
- Voting ensemble and standalone performance comparison
- Visualized feature importance, confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves
- Actionable driver retention recommendations

### 🧠 Model Metrics:
| Metric            | Value   |
|-------------------|---------|
| Accuracy          | 93.0%   |
| Precision (Churn) | 98.0%   |
| Recall (Churn)    | 91.0%   |
| F1-Score (Churn)  | 95.0%   |
| AUC Score         | 0.9742  |

> This complements the Azure ML deployment version and demonstrates versatility across AutoML and manual MLOps workflows.
